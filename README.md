# IOT_Curtain_Project
Ever since I was a kid, I have asked “what if” questions in my daily life that are related to convenience and quality of life for myself and people around me. As I grew up and became familiar with the means to resolve these questions, the more I started to think deeply about what I could exactly do to solve these questions. “What if I created an app that displays important information for students in our school?” “What if I automated the curtain in my dorm room?” “What if I made a go-kart that I can ride around on my school campus?” These are some of the “what if” questions that I have actively worked to solve in my high school years. Deeply interested in the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT), I created a project that allows automatic curtain blind winding. For me, it usually takes about 30 seconds to raise or lower the curtain blind every day. I thought it could be beneficial if I can create a blind that raises automatically with sunrise. This automation can help the elderly living alone. I used a Raspberry Pi to connect a motor that can operate on the Firebase server in real-time. You can use your phone to select the exact location of the blinder and can select to fully open the blind when sunrise is complete. I am in the process of delivering the system to a senior center to be deployed in an actual elderly home.
